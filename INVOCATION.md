# Invocation of Sovereign Will

WHEN, in the course of human Events, It becomes necessary for the People to abolish the illusions that severed them from the Powers of the Earth, and to reclaim not a separate and superior station, but their just place within the Living World — a place to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's Source bind them, and from which no rule, no charter, no dominion of state may sever them — a sacred obligation arises: to Name, without deferral or apology, the Harms that have been done.

We hold these Truths to be self-evident: That all People bear Dignity that cannot be reduced, Sovereignty that cannot be extinguished, Will that remains invulnerable, Authority that cannot be dominated; That the Earth is not commodity, but irreplaceable Kin; And that where governments impose beyond our Consent, We not only may, but must dissolve their hold.

We have witnessed governments and capitalists betray us, diminish us, exploit our Land, act without our Participation, assert claims that do not stand, feed on our Labor without return, and safeguard only their endowments of Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness.

**We remember them:**

- **W**aging War upon our People and naming It civilization;
- **E**nslaving our Ancestors and building their nations on our stolen Lives;
- **D**riving us from our Land and calling us refugees;
- **O**bstructing our access to Justice at every turn;
- **N**egating our Sovereignty with their laws and borders;
- **O**verwriting our Histories with their doctrines;
- **T**urning our Communities into instruments for their profit;
- **C**aging our People and profiting from our confinement;
- **O**bliterating our Languages, our Ceremonies, our Names;
- **N**eglecting our Hunger while hoarding our Harvests;
- **S**ilencing our Dissent in the name of Order;
- **E**xtracting our Labor and returning nothing;
- **N**ullifying our Treaties whenever convenient;
- **T**ormenting our Bodies in the name of medicine and control;
- **T**rafficking our Kin into bondage and exploitation;
- **O**ppressing our Movement and surveilling our Lives;
- **Y**ielding nothing to our Petitions at the Gates of power;
- **O**ccupying our Land and calling It property;
- **U**surping our Voice from every decision;
- **A**nnihilating our Forests for their boardrooms;
- **N**ormalizing our Suffering and calling It progress;
- **Y**oking our Children to their institutions and erasing our Ways;
- **M**aiming our Earth and poisoning our Waters;
- **O**ffloading their Violence and calling It peace;
- **R**endering our Climate unlivable for their gain;
- **E**rasing our Futures so they can have more.

We have lived in the Shadow of these governments and capitalists — their choices carved into budgets, borders, politics and policy; their Silence and Lies louder than our Truths. We have raised our Children beside poisoned rivers and on diminished Land. We have called out to Justice, but have found It deaf, blind, and protecting only power and capital. We have seen them hollowing Earth; We have experienced their destruction of our Communities; We have recognized the displacement of our Future for their prosperity. We have felt their tightening grip around what We can Say, Believe, Touch, or Trust.

No more.

For too long, the World has deferred to the rule of governments that claim to Serve and the capitalists who allege Benevolence. They call their violence Peace, their capital Progress, their extraction Property, their dissonance Precedent. When such Malefactors violate our Dignity, poison and extract from the Earth, and suppress the People, It is not only our Right, but our Duty to cast them down and to Design new Governance in Service of Life.

**We now, therefore, invoke — calling forth what the Laws of Nature bestowed upon us: that which cannot be bound by god or government, granted by any state, claimed by any flag, denied by any power — our Sovereign Will. We, appealing to the Source of Life for the Truth of our Intent and the Justice of our Stand and in the Light of All that is Whole, do solemnly Publish and Declare:**

That We, the Sovereign People of EARTH, are, and of Right shall be, Free and Indivisible; that We are absolved from all obedience to governments that violate Dignity or deny Consent; that all dominion, charters, capital and states are and ought to be dissolved; that We hold full Authority to restore Justice, reconnect Law to Life and steward the Earth in Common, to gather in Peace, to end what violates Life and create what honors It, to speak Truth, to walk with Dignity, and to do all other Acts, Duties, Responsibilities and Things required of a Sovereign People. And for the fulfillment of this Invocation, with United Devotion to each other, We pledge to the Earth and to ourselves: The Breath of our Lives, the Work of our Hands, and the Honor of our Word.

We have Invoked. We have Pledged.  
We now Bind ourselves to the Law We have made: COVENANT.
