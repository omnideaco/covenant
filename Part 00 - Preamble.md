# Preamble

We the Sovereign People of Earth, in Order to uphold our Dignity, restore Justice, protect our Land, preserve our Peace, and secure our Blessings of Liberty, do ordain and establish this Covenant for the Earth and all its People.

By this act, We extinguish all former states that governed without our Consent, all constitutions that placed power above our Life, and all law that bound us without our Authority.

No claim to rule, no charter of empire, no inherited order shall hold power over us, nor speak in our Name, nor bind our Future. Let them be known and remembered, for their time has passed, and in the wake of our Word, they stand null and void. 

Only that which arises from our Sovereign Will is the Law.
